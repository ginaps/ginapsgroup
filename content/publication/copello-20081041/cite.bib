 abstract = {An antimicrobial coating was evaluated in this work for its antimicrobial efficacy against common food-borne pathogens. Dodecyl-di(aminoethyl)-glycine, an organic disinfectant, was immobilized in a silicon oxide matrix to generate thin films over surfaces by means of the sol-gel process. Tetraethoxysilane was used as the polymeric precursor. No alteration of optical transparency on the covered surfaces was observed. Topographic images obtained with atomic force microscopy showed a homogeneous film with no additional roughness added by the polymer to the surface. The attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectral data showed the presence of dodecyl-di(aminoethyl)-glycine in the silicon oxide network after a normal cleaning procedure. The antimicrobial efficacy test was performed by exposing coated slides to suspensions of common food-borne pathogens: Escherichia coli, Staphyloccocus aureus, E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhi, S. cholerasuiss, Listeria innocua and L. monocytogenes. The coating activity was not only bacteriostatic but also bactericidal. The percent reduction of viable microorganism exposure over 24 h to the coated surface ranged between 99.5%, for the more resistant gram-positive bacteria, and over 99.999%, for most gram-negative bacteria. The silicon matrix itself did not account for any reduction of viable microbial, even more an increase was observed. © 2008 Society for Industrial Microbiology.},
