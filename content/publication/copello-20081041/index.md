abstract: 'An antimicrobial coating was evaluated in this work for its antimicrobial
  efficacy against common food-borne pathogens. Dodecyl-di(aminoethyl)-glycine, an
  organic disinfectant, was immobilized in a silicon oxide matrix to generate thin
  films over surfaces by means of the sol-gel process. Tetraethoxysilane was used
  as the polymeric precursor. No alteration of optical transparency on the covered
  surfaces was observed. Topographic images obtained with atomic force microscopy
  showed a homogeneous film with no additional roughness added by the polymer to the
  surface. The attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectral data
  showed the presence of dodecyl-di(aminoethyl)-glycine in the silicon oxide network
  after a normal cleaning procedure. The antimicrobial efficacy test was performed
  by exposing coated slides to suspensions of common food-borne pathogens: Escherichia
  coli, Staphyloccocus aureus, E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhi, S. cholerasuiss,
  Listeria innocua and L. monocytogenes. The coating activity was not only bacteriostatic
  but also bactericidal. The percent reduction of viable microorganism exposure over
  24 h to the coated surface ranged between 99.5%, for the more resistant gram-positive
  bacteria, and over 99.999%, for most gram-negative bacteria. The silicon matrix
  itself did not account for any reduction of viable microbial, even more an increase
  was observed. © 2008 Society for Industrial Microbiology.'
