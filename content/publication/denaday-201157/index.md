abstract: The aim of this work was the development of a reusable enzymatic reactor
  based on soybean peroxidase for analytical purposes in a flow system. The innovation
  consisted in the application of a polyampholyte as a support for the immobilization
  of the enzyme extracted from soybean seed coat, without previous purification. A
  polyampholyte with high loading capacity for proteins was tested as a sorbent, reaching
  a maximum adsorption capacity (q0) of 0.10mgg-1 and an equilibrium dissociation
  constant (Kd) of 1.3×10-8M. The catalytic activities of free and immobilized enzyme
  were first compared in batch. The Michaelis constant (Km) for phenol at saturating
  H2O2 decreased upon immobilization. The reactor was then coupled to an amperometric
  detector in a flow system. The effects of the immobilization on kinetics and equilibrium
  parameters were evaluated using catechol and H2O2 as substrates. The values for
  the apparent Michaelis constant for catechol (K'm) were higher than the intrinsic
  parameter of the immobilized enzyme (Km, 0.08mM) due to external mass-transport
  limitations. Internal diffusional restrictions were absent since the normalized
  Eadie-Hofstee plots did not exhibit sigmoidal curves. The reactor was tested as
  an analytical tool for food analysis. The enzymatic activity was stable over two
  months. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.
