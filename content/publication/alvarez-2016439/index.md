abstract: We present a brief survey of some of the recent work of Professor Luis E.
  Díaz, performed together with his students and collaborators at the University of
  Buenos Aires. Dr Luis E. Díaz has been involved in research on biochemical and pharmaceutical
  sciences solving scientific and industry problems for over 40 years until he passed
  away. Prof. Díaz scientific interests included various topics from NMR spectroscopy
  to biomedicine but fundamentally he focused in various aspects of chemistry (analytical,
  organic, inorganic and environmental). This is not a complete survey but a sampling
  of prominent projects related to sol-gel chemistry with a focus on some of his recent
  publications. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.
