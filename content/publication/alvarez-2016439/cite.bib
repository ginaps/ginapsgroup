 abstract = {We present a brief survey of some of the recent work of Professor Luis E. Díaz, performed together with his students and collaborators at the University of Buenos Aires. Dr Luis E. Díaz has been involved in research on biochemical and pharmaceutical sciences solving scientific and industry problems for over 40 years until he passed away. Prof. Díaz scientific interests included various topics from NMR spectroscopy to biomedicine but fundamentally he focused in various aspects of chemistry (analytical, organic, inorganic and environmental). This is not a complete survey but a sampling of prominent projects related to sol-gel chemistry with a focus on some of his recent publications. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.},
