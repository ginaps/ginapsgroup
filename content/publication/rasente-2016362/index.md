abstract: Cardiovascular disease is the largest single cause of morbid-mortality in
  the world. However, there is still no pharmaceutical treatment that directly targets
  the blood vessel wall instead of just controlling the risk factors. Here, we produced
  polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) by a simple and reproducible polyelectrolyte complexation
  method between low molecular mass dermatan sulfate (polyanionic polysaccharide)
  and chitosan (polycationic polysaccharide), and evaluated the cellular uptake by
  vascular endothelial cells. The composition and the composition homogeneity of PECs
  were confirmed by 13C-CP-MAS spectroscopy and by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,
  respectively. The hydrodynamic radius, determined by dynamic light scattering, was
  729 ± 11 nm. PECs were not cytotoxic for a murine heart endothelium-derived cell
  line. Fluorescent confocal microscopy showed the specific uptake of fluorescently-labeled
  PECs by endothelial cells when they were cultured alone or in the presence of macrophages.
  Overall, these findings confirmed the potential of these PECs for targeting different
  agents to the vessel wall in the prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of vascular
  disease. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
