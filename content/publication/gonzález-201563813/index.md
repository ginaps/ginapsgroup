abstract: In this work, we present two novel nanostructured hybrid materials based
  on a chitin matrix loaded with increasing amounts of graphene oxide and reduced
  graphene oxide nanosheets (nGO and rGO, respectively). Both kinds of material (Chi:nGO
  and Chi:rGO) were studied using different spectroscopic and rheological techniques
  with the aim of understanding the interaction mechanism between chitin and nGO/rGO
  and explaining how the type of filler and its proportion affects its reinforcement.
  The production of these hybrids represents not only the obtention of low-cost materials
  with mechanical resistance but also a good opportunity for developing materials
  with several applications according to their composition. The nGO and rGO were characterised
  through FT-IR and ESR for the determination of the oxidation degree of each nanofiller.
  Then, the hybrids were spectroscopically analysed with FT-IR, ESR and SAXS which
  demonstrated that the components do not interact through covalent bonding and the
  nanosheets are well-dispersed among the chitin matrix. Finally, a rheological behavior
  assay was performed and its results were analysed in terms of G′ and η∗. In short,
  all the results allowed us to conclude that nGO acts as a more efficient reinforcer
  than rGO due to the higher amount of hydrogen bonding established with chitin. ©
