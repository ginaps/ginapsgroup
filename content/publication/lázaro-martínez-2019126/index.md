abstract: Polyethylenimine (PEI)-decorated gold nanoparticles (AuNP) were electrodeposited
  on conductive surfaces in one-step procedure. Solution-state NMR evidenced that
  chloride from PEI.HCl was partially exchanged by AuCl 4 − prior to AuNP formation.
  XPS studies indicated the presence of Au° together with the interaction between
  AuNP with nitrogen atoms of the PEI polymer. The particle size by DLS was 49 nm.
  The electrochemical behavior of bare electrode and of glassy carbon electrode modified
  with PEI-decorated AuNP was compared using [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3-/4- redox probe, to determine
  the potential role of the nanomaterial and of the polymer in the detection of proteins.
  The most relevant experimental variables from cyclic voltammetry (CV), square-wave
  voltammetry (SWV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used for
  the characterization of protein uptake. The adsorption by electrostatic interaction
  between the biomolecules and the positively charged polymer (PEIH + ) affected negatively
  the current response (Ip) of the probe, especially when the negatively charged protein
  was involved. This platform resulted adequate to immobilize proteins and to characterize
  this process, for further applications as a tool in bioanalysis or biotechnology.
