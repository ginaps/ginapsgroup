abstract: The photocatalytic degradation of different emergent contaminants in aqueous
  solutions has been studied by using oligomer-coated TiO2 nanoparticles under solar
  light irradiation. The oligomer was synthesized using methacrylic acid, ethylene
  glycol diglycidyl ether and imidazole. The material was characterized by SEM, DLS,
  FT-IR and FT-Raman and UV-vis spectroscopy. The photocatalytic behavior with the
  model azo-dye methyl orange was analyzed in different conditions (initial concentration
  and pH) and the kinetic parameters were described by using the Langmuir-Hinshelwood
  model. The reuse and photocorrosion of the nanoparticles was studied up to seven
  operative cycles. The oligomer-coated nanoparticles showed better performance than
  the uncoated ones due to an increment in absorption in the visible light region.
  The charge transfer process would form electron/hole pairs (e-/h+) with the holes
  localized on the organic ligands (most probably on imidazole residues from oligomers)
  and the electrons in the conduction band of TiO2. Supernatant safety after the photocatalytic
  treatment was examined by the lettuce seeds assay and no toxicity was found. The
  versatility of the material was studied by exposing it to different emergent contaminants
  (ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim and chloramphenicol). Â© 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry
