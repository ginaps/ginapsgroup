abstract: This work describes a novel delivery system for targeting egg-derived anti-inflammatory
  tripeptide Ile-Arg-Trp (IRW) to endothelial cells. The nanomedicine is synthesized
  by a simple and reproducible ionotropic gelification method that results in the
  efficient loading of the positively charged IRW within the dermatan sulfate/ chitosan
  matrix, as demonstrated by ss-NMR spectroscopy. The incorporation of IRW results
  in a stable nanoparticle dispersion with a single size population of 442 ± 43 nm.
  Fluorescence microscopy studies demonstrate the capacity of the nanomaterial to
  distinguish between a quiescent and an injured endothelium through the interaction
  of dermatan sulfate with the CD44 receptor. Remarkably, no additional surface functionalization
  is required as dermatan sulfate mediates their internalization and the intracellular
  release of this natural anti-inflammatory tripeptide to modulate endothelial inflammatory
  response. This simple, scalable, and versatile nanotechnology platform opens new
  opportunities to apply in the therapy of vascular disease. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd
