abstract: A one step-synthesized polyampholyte, bearing carboxylate and 2-methylimidazole
  (2MI) groups, was tested as adsorbent for the removal of Pb(II) and Cd(II) from
  aqueous solutions. This material combines the benefits of synthetic polymers, such
  as high adsorption capacity and chemical stability, and the advantages of biosorbents
  in regard of costs and simplicity of the production.The short time needed to achieve
  the adsorption equilibrium indicated a chemical-reaction controlled process. A network
  expansion was predicted as a result of repulsive interaction between the fixed positive
  charges.Langmuir model presented the best fitting to isotherm equilibrium data,
  with a maximum adsorption capacity of 182mgg -1 for Cd(II) and 202mgg -1 for Pb(II).
  The metal removal was strongly dependent on pH, involving carboxylate and 2MI residues.
  An ion-exchange process for Pb(II) and Cd(II), combined with coordination for the
  later, were the most probable mechanism of interaction. The adsorption of 1.35ppm
  Cd(II) was 72±6% in well-water, and the adsorption of 0.50ppm Pb(II) was 62±5% in
  tap-water. The recovery figures for Cd(II) in 1% HNO 3 were optimal. © 2012 Elsevier
