abstract: Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and immunoperoxidase assay (IPA) are useful
  diagnostic techniques for specific antibody detection for different diseases. Both
  involve several alternatives for immobilization of cells, such as solvent or heat
  fixation. Non-covalent immobilization implies rigorous storage conditions at - 20 °C
  to preserve the slides, and usually numerous cells are detached during the washing
  steps, which can lead to inconsistencies in the results. Sol-gel chemistry is usually
  used for coating different materials because of the mild conditions of the polymerization
  reaction and the ability to introduce functional groups to a wide variety of surfaces.
  We have developed a novel procedure for the attachment of Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes
  and Leishmania guyanensis promastigotes to a silicon oxide polymer covered glass
  surface. The film was prepared using standard microscope slides with tetraethoxysilane
  and 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane as polymeric precursors. When acetone was used
  as the major coating solvent, the IFA showed the fluorescence of the attached parasites
  without matrix background interference. Similar results were observed when the IPA
  was evaluated. The sensitivity and specificity of the sol-gel immobilized parasite
  slides were comparable with the heat fixation technique. The performance of the
  coated slides was maintained for at least 2 months at 4 °C storage temperature.
  This immobilization method does not affect the molecular epitopes of the attached
  cells. Thus, homogeneous, ready to use, long lasting coated slides were obtained,
  which are appropriate for field conditions. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
