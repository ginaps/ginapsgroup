abstract: Direct protein purification from raw materials by chromatographic media
  represents an enormous challenge, especially when particulate solids and high charge
  solute are present. In this sense, protein purification from cheese whey is an excellent
  opportunity to test new chromatographic matrices that can be applied to direct protein
  isolation. The present work shows the utility of novel multimodal chitosan-based
  chromatographic matrices for obtaining lactoferrin (LF) and a whey protein isolate
  (WPI) directly from cheese whey without any pretreatment. A central composite experimental
  design was used to optimise an operative sequence. This sequence involved LF capture
  using sulfanilic acid-modified chitosan mini-spheres followed by the capture of
  the massive remnant proteins using glycidyl trimethylammonium-modified chitosan
  mini-spheres. Interestingly, a yield of 68% and 70% purity degree was obtained for
  LF, and 2.71 mg of WPI mL−1 whey was obtained in the WPI recovery process, revealing
  a potential industrial use of the developed matrices and processes. © 2020 Elsevier
