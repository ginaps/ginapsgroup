abstract: 'A novel material that combines mechanical resistance with ampholyte character
  was easily obtained by the reaction of methacrylic acid, 2-methylimidazole and ethylene
  glycol diglycidyl ether. The structure was studied by solid-state 13C NMR and FT
  IR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and potentiometric titration.
  The interaction of this new material with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model
  protein was explored. The protein bound electrostatically to the basic form of the
  polyampholyte at low ionic strength even when both species had negative net charge.
  The BSA-polyampholyte complex was evidenced by FT IR and SEM. The adsorption properties
  were optimal, attributed to the combination of basic and acid groups in the same
  network, with a maximum loading capacity of 0.7307 g g-1 and a Kd: 5.70 × 10-6 evaluated
  by the Langmuir model. The release of BSA was controlled by dissociation kinetics
  of the complex rather than by diffusion, and the total desorbed amount depended
  on the electrolyte content of the medium. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.'
