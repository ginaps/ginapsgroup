abstract: The solgel process has several well-known advantages such as high purity
  precursors, homogeneity of the obtained material and especially the possibility
  of making hybrids and composite materials with new chemical and mechanical properties.
  This emerging field of material science has generated considerable and increasing
  interest from researchers of various disciplines. Recent advances due to the generation
  of multidisciplinary investigations have allowed real interesting advances in biology
  and medicine applications. The relation with the biomedical applications involves
  principally the development of methods for treatment, diagnosis, monitoring and
  control of biological systems. The first part of this chapter is dedicated to illustrate
  latest development in the immobilization of bactericide ions such as silver, copper
  or zinc and organic compounds with proven antimicrobial properties to obtain antimicrobial
  coatings, since microbial surface contamination control is an important tool for
  the prevention of infectious diseases. Secondly, due to the fact that early detection
  of infectious diseases is of great importance for the implementation of efficient
  treatments the entrapment of proteins, bacteria and parasites for the detection
  of infectious diseases is presented. The final section is an overview of the state
  of the art in materials for the treatment of human diseases including drug delivery
  systems and materials for tissue engineering achieved with the aid of sol-gel chemistry.
