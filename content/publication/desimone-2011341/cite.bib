 abstract = {The solgel process has several well-known advantages such as high purity precursors, homogeneity of the obtained material and especially the possibility of making hybrids and composite materials with new chemical and mechanical properties. This emerging field of material science has generated considerable and increasing interest from researchers of various disciplines. Recent advances due to the generation of multidisciplinary investigations have allowed real interesting advances in biology and medicine applications. The relation with the biomedical applications involves principally the development of methods for treatment, diagnosis, monitoring and control of biological systems. The first part of this chapter is dedicated to illustrate latest development in the immobilization of bactericide ions such as silver, copper or zinc and organic compounds with proven antimicrobial properties to obtain antimicrobial coatings, since microbial surface contamination control is an important tool for the prevention of infectious diseases. Secondly, due to the fact that early detection of infectious diseases is of great importance for the implementation of efficient treatments the entrapment of proteins, bacteria and parasites for the detection of infectious diseases is presented. The final section is an overview of the state of the art in materials for the treatment of human diseases including drug delivery systems and materials for tissue engineering achieved with the aid of sol-gel chemistry.
