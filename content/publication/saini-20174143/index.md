abstract: "A method is described for simultaneous determination of trace levels of\
  \ three isomeric mononitrophenols (MNPs) in environmental water samples using chitin\
  \ (cheap, effective, biocompatible, green and safe) based solid phase extraction\
  \ and high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection. Various parameters\
  \ were investigated and optimized for extraction and enrichment of three MNPs, and\
  \ chitin-MNP adsorption was investigated using SEM, FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy.\
  \ Validation tests of spiked water samples showed good linearities for all three\
  \ MNPs (R2 = 0.9990-0.9999) over a wide concentration range of 0.001-1 μg mL-1.\
  \ Limits of detection (LODs) and quantification (LOQs) were measured at ng mL-1\
  \ levels: 0.13 ng mL-1 and 0.39 ng mL-1 for 2-NP, 0.09 ng mL-1 and 0.27 ng mL-1\
  \ for 3-NP and 0.19 ng mL-1 and 0.57 ng mL-1 for 4-NP. Inter- and intra-day precision\
  \ tests showed variations of 1.67-1.80%, 1.06-1.56%, and 1.14-1.62% for 2-NP, 3-NP,\
  \ and 4-NP, respectively. Average recoveries were in the range of 56.70-97.51%,\
  \ with relative standard deviations below 15%. The developed method was then applied\
  \ to analyze 8 real environmental water samples. Moreover, 4-NP was the most frequently\
  \ detected MNP at concentration levels of 0.749-0.947 μg mL-1, followed by 2-NP.\
  \ Furthermore, 3-NP was not detected in any studied real sample. The validated method\
  \ is simple and economical, with adequate sensitivity for trace levels of three\
  \ isomeric MNPs. This method could be adopted by water quality analysis laboratories\
  \ and allows an easy expansion to other related nitrophenols (NP) in water matrices'\
