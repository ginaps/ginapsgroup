abstract: Biofilms are common in nature and are often associated with undesirable
  effects such as the deterioration of concrete, metal corrosion, fouling of oil and
  gas pipelines and ships hulls, dental plaques causing tooth decay, and microbial
  colonization of indwelling or percutaneous medical devices, such as catheters, artificial
  valves, joints, and stents. Nanomaterials with distinctive physicochemical properties
  and high surface areas are offering new alternatives for the development of antibiofilm
  and bactericidal surfaces. In order to obtain antimicrobial coatings several approaches
  will be described. One approach consists of using a controlled-release nanostructured
  coating, in which the antibiotic is released from the biomedical device and intercepts
  bacteria in the vicinity. The disadvantage of the release approach is that the duration
  and effectiveness of antibacterial action are limited by loading and release kinetics.
  The second approach consists on the application of a molecular surface layer of
  covalently immobilized (“grafted”) molecules or on the modification of surface nanotopography,
  which can prevent bacterial attachment to material surfaces by either killing bacteria
  or changing physicochemical characteristics of the surfaces (hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity,
  charge, surface free energy, nanoroughness). In addition, much longer, perhaps indefinite,
  effectiveness can be ascertained by using this approach. © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All
