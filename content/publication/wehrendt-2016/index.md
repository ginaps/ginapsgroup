abstract: It is well established that binding of p120 catenin to the cytoplasmic domain
  of surface cadherin prevents cadherin endocytosis and degradation, contributing
  to cell-cell adhesion. In the present work we show that p120 catenin bound to the
  N-cadherin precursor, contributes to its anterograde movement from the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex. In HeLa cells, depletion of p120 expression,
  or blocking its binding to N-cadherin, increased the accumulation of the precursor
  in the ER, while it decreased the localization of mature N-cadherin at intercellular
  junctions. Reconstitution experiments in p120-deficient SW48 cells with all three
  major isoforms of p120 (1, 3 and 4) had similar capacity to promote the processing
  of the N-cadherin precursor to the mature form, and its localization at cell-cell
  junctions. P120 catenin and protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B facilitated the recruitment
  of the N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF), an ATPase involved in vesicular
  trafficking, to the N-cadherin precursor complex. Dominant negative NSF E329Q impaired
  N-cadherin trafficking, maturation and localization at cell-cell junctions. Our
  results uncover a new role for p120 catenin bound to the N-cadherin precursor ensuring
  its trafficking through the biosynthetic pathway towards the cell surface. © 2016
