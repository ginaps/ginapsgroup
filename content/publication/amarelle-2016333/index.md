abstract: Ensifer meliloti is a nitrogen-fixing symbiont of the alfalfa legume able
  to use heme as an iron source. The transport mechanism involved in heme acquisition
  in E. meliloti has been identified and characterized, but the fate of heme once
  inside the cell is not known. In silico analysis of E. meliloti 1021 genome revealed
  no canonical heme oxygenases although two genes encoding putative heme degrading
  enzymes, smc01518 and hmuS, were identified. SMc01518 is similar to HmuQ of Bradyrhizobium
  japonicum, which is weakly homologous to the Staphylococcus aureus IsdG heme-degrading
  monooxygenase, whereas HmuS is homolog to Pseudomonas aeruginosa PhuS, a protein
  reported as a heme chaperone and as a heme degrading enzyme. Recombinant HmuQ and
  HmuS were able to bind hemin with a 1:1 stoichiometry and displayed a Kd value of
  5 and 4 μM, respectively. HmuS degrades heme in vitro to the biliverdin isomers
  IX-β and IX-δ in an equimolar ratio. The HmuQ recombinant protein degrades heme
  to biliverdin IX-δ only. Additionally, in this work we demonstrate that humS and
  hmuQ gene expression is regulated by iron and heme in a RirA dependent manner and
  that both proteins are involved in heme metabolism in E. meliloti in vivo. © Springer
