abstract: Protein based hydrogels are a very interesting type of biomaterials with
  many probed strengths related to their source and chemical structure. Biocompatibility
  and biodegradability are accompanied by affordability when it comes to low cost
  sources. The main keratin source is agroindustrial waste, such as feathers, horns,
  hooves, hair and wool. Thus, the main cost of keratin hydrogels derives from their
  processing. Here is presented a new strategy for the obtaining of a keratin hydrogel
  with enhanced mechanical properties using low cost reagents. This keratin hydrogel
  is stiff enough to allow handling without special cares and also presenting a reversible
  pH-responsive behavior. The minimum swelling is observed at low pH due to a collapsed
  and disordered protein network with water tightly adsorbed to the hydrophilic sites.
  The swelling rises significantly above pH 6 and the maximum swelling appears above
  pH 8 where an expanded network allows water to enter to the pores. © 2017 Elsevier
