abstract: A coating comprising quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) and aliphatic moieties
  was formed on the poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) surface in order to confer antibacterial
  activity. This was achieved by grafting mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane onto PVC,
  followed by aminopropyltriethoxysilane. Betaine and dodecenyl succinic anhydride
  (DDSA) were bonded to free amine groups. The modified PVC samples were characterized
  by FT-IR, showing that the PVC surface was successfully coated. Energy dispersive
  X-ray spectroscopy showed the spatial distributions of the elements Si and S, indicating
  that the coatings were homogeneous. Betaine and DDSA coated PVC showed a better
  antibacterial performance than the controls. This antibacterial effect was extremely
  reinforced in betaine-DDSA modified PVC showing greater antibacterial activity than
  both treatments separately applied. Antibacterial activity against Acinetobacter
  baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis
  was studied in the treated samples showing that the coating was effective against
  Gram positive and Gram negative species. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the
