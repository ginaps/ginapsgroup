abstract: A low-cost biosorbent hybrid material ready for application was obtained
  in this work. Yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) milling residual dust was used as
  a polyphenol source by ethanolic extraction. Polyphenols were immobilized within
  a SiO2 matrix to form an interpenetrated polymer after glutaraldehyde cross-linking.
  Pb(II), Cr(III) and Cr(VI) were chosen as model metals for adsorption. The hybrid
  materials were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR),
  Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and
  Nitrogen Adsorption Isotherms. Adsorption experimental data were analysed using
  Langmuir, Freundlich, Dubinin-Radushkevich, Temkin, Redlich-Peterson, Sips and Toth
  isotherm models along with the evaluation of adsorption energy and standard free
  energy (ΔG°). The adsorption was observed to be pH dependent. The main mechanism
  of metal adsorption was found to be a spontaneous charge associated interaction.
  Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy confirmed that Cr(VI) adsorption was
  an adsorption-coupled reaction and the adsorbed specie was Cr(V). The hybrid matrix
  probed its adsorption capacity of Cr(III) in a non-treated tannery wastewater. ©
