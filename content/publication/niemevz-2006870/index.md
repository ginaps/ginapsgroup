abstract: A synthetic route to mono-meso-ferrocenyl porphyrins using a MacDonald-type
  2+2 condensation is described. In this method, the substituted diformyldipyrrylmethane
  4 is treated with the dicarboxydipyrrylmethane 6. The 5-ferrocenyldipyrrylmethane
  was obtained by condensation of benzyl 3-methyl-4-ethylpyrrol-2-carboxylate with
  ferrocenecarboxaldehyde in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid. The unequivocal
  assignment of all proton resonances in the new porphyrin was achieved by means of
  a detailed analysis of its H-H NOESY correlations. Interestingly, we noticed that
  the ferrocenyl group introduces an element of asymmetry in the molecule. The corresponding
  Co(II) and Ni(II) complexes were also prepared. In cyclic voltammograms of the free
  base and the Co or Ni complexes all voltammetric peaks disappear after four consecutive
  scans. This result suggests no film formation in any of them. © Georg Thieme Verlag
