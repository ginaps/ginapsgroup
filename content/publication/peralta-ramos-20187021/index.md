abstract: In this work, the influence of graphene oxide (GO) reinforcement on keratin
  based smart hydrogel and its application for the emerging pollutant ciprofloxacin
  removal was studied. Firstly, the obtained material was characterized by Infrared
  Spectroscopy, Scanning Electronic Microscopy, Small angle X-ray Scattering and Swelling
  and Rheological behavior. The results showed that the keratin hydrogel and those
  nanocomposites containing GO present stimuli responsive behavior by changing the
  swelling along with the pH. Keratin hydrogels and the ones containing 0.5% of GO
  showed a similar behavior where swelling decreased between pH 6 and 5. The introduction
  of GO at 2% changed this inflection point at a value between pH 7 and 6. Also, the
  swelling of the shrunk hydrogels was higher when containing 2% GO. This effect was
  probably due to the steric hindrance generated by the nanosheets and their functional
  groups, partially interfering with keratin chains interaction. The antibiotic was
  adsorbed in the different active sites in the hydrogel provided by the keratin and
  the GO structures. After that, the composite adsorption isotherms against ciprofloxacin
  (CPX) and its kinetics were studied. The ability of the material to expand at high
  pH allowed a better desorption of the CPX. Thus, reusability presented a better
  performance when basic washings were used. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
