abstract: In this work, the influence of Sodium Acetate Trihydrate (SAT) on the gelling
  stage of a chitin hydrogel was studied. Characterization techniques, such as FTIR,
  Raman, solid-state NMR, Dielectric Spectroscopy, Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS),
  Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to study
  the effect of SAT on the micro and nanostructure of the material in the wet, dry
  and freeze-dried states. It was demonstrated that the amount of SAT in the gelling
  solution can induce a variation in the supramolecular interaction among the polysaccharide
  chains, which leads to a change in the structural characteristics. In addition,
  it was observed that the polymer-water interactions are also altered by this structural
  ordering. Also, the affinity interaction with lysozyme was evaluated and an influence
  on the adsorption capacity was evidenced with the use of SAT. This could be an advance
  for biotechnological, biomedical, and food applications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
