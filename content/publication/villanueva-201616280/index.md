abstract: In order to obtain an antimicrobial gel, a starch-based hydrogel reinforced
  with silica-coated copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) was developed. Cu NPs were synthesized
  by use of a copper salt and hydrazine as a reducing agent. In order to enhance Cu
  NP stability over time, they were synthesized in a starch medium followed by a silica
  coating. The starch hydrogel was prepared by use of urea and water as plasticizers
  and it was treated with different concentrations of silica-coated copper nanoparticles
  (Si-Cu NPs). The obtained materials were characterized by Fourier transform infrared
  (FT-IR) spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, scanning
  electron microscopy (SEM), and rheometry. FT-IR and EPR spectra were used for characterization
  of Cu NPs and Si-Cu NPs, confirming that a starch cap was formed around the Cu NP
  and demonstrating the stability of the copper nanoparticle after the silica coating
  step. SEM images showed Cu NP, Si-Cu NP, and hydrogel morphology. The particle size
  was polydisperse and the structure of the gels changed along with particle concentration.
  Increased NP content led to larger pores in starch structure. These results were
  in accordance with the rheological behavior, where reinforcement by the Si-Cu NP
  was seen. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated against Gram-negative (Escherichia
  coli) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacterial species. The hydrogels
  were demonstrated to maintain antimicrobial activity for at least four cycles of
  use. A dermal acute toxicity test showed that the material could be scored as slightly
  irritant, proving its biocompatibility. With these advantages, it is believed that
  the designed Si-Cu NP loaded hydrogel may show high potential for applications in
  various clinical fields, such as wound dressings and fillers. © 2016 American Chemical
