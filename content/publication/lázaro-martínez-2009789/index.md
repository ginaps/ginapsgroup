abstract: 'This paper presents a material that has both hydrophilic and hydrophobic
  domains, obtained by combination of a polyampholyte with a surfactant. This material
  was fully characterized by different spectroscopic techniques and microscopy. Bisphenol-A
  (BPA) was chosen as a model molecule to study the interaction with compounds of
  intermediate polarity. We explored the kinetics and equilibrium of BPA on the surface
  of the polyampholyte-surfactant complex and found a significantly high loading capacity
  (2.02 mmol g-1) and complete binding from solutions at concentration levels below
  100 μmol L-1. The complex was encapsulated in agarose gel to be used as solid phase
  for extraction of BPA from food simulants in contact with polycarbonate bottles
  under different treatments. Bisphenol was preconcentrated, extracted and analysed
  by liquid chromatography with an amperometric detector. The instrumental detection
  limit of the technique was 10 μg L-1, which was lowered to 0.14 μg L-1 by the preconcentration
  step. The BPA released from baby bottles was 2.1 ng cm-2 (σn - 1: 0.1) in the first
  use with distilled water. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.'
