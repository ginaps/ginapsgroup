abstract: A novel nanostructured material was successfully developed by combining
  a chitin matrix with graphene oxide nanosheets (Chi:nGO) and then used for the continuous
  flow adsorption of ciprofloxacin. The spectroscopic characterization indicated that
  none covalent interaction between both components would be occurring and the introduction
  of nGO did not interfere in chitin nanostructure rearrangement during gelling and
  later drying. SEM images and Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry results showed a wide
  pore size distribution ranging from nano to micrometers. The continuous flow adsorption
  was observed to be dependent on the pH which affects the electrostatic interaction.
  The flow rate, Na+ concentration and water hardness were evaluated to describe the
  adsorption process. The resistance to alkali allowed to regenerate and reuse the
  column for subsequent adsorption cycles. Finally, ciprofloxacin spiked real water
  samples were assessed and the results confirmed that the medium pH was the main
  parameter that defines the adsorption behavior. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd
