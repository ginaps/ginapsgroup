abstract: A composite biosorbent retaining non-covalently bound chitin in between
  layers of a silicon oxide matrix was assessed for lysozyme purification from undiluted
  egg white. The matrix can be shaped with big size and high density, thus allowing
  its efficient separation from the egg white after the adsorption step. The lysozyme-depleted
  egg white can follow its usual commercialisation route. A surface area of 142 m2/g
  and a total pore volume of 0.295 cm3/g were calculated from the nitrogen sorption
  isotherms. Its water content was 78.3%. The matrix structure is the result of the
  polysaccharide addition to the polymerisation mixture, which is known to influence
  the condensation process, leading to a material with characteristic properties.
  A maximum capacity of 117.1 ± 9 mg lysozyme/g and a dissociation constant of 0.73
  ± 0.15 mg/mL were calculated from the Langmuir isotherm. A lysozyme purification
  batch process from undiluted egg white was developed, where 87% of the lysozyme
  was removed from the egg white and the matrix was easily recovered by a simple filtration
  through a strainer. The overall yield of the process was 64% with a purification
  factor of 20. © Springer-Verlag 2010.
