abstract: A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with electrochemical
  detection (ED) using a monolithic column was developed and validated for the simultaneous
  quantitative determination of aniline, 2-aminobiphenyl, and 4-aminobiphenyl in diphenylamine
  samples. The proposed HPLC method provides a shorter analysis time as compared to
  previously reported ones (less than 4 min). Method validation was performed in terms
  of sensitivity, repeatability, linearity, accuracy, detection limit, and quantification
  limit. It is found that the method has high accuracy and precision. The limits of
  detection obtained were 0.23 ng/mL for aniline and 0.30 ng/mL for 2-aminobiphenyl,
  4-aminobiphenyl, and diphenylamine. Â© Pleiades Publishing, Inc., 2006.
