abstract: 'Quinoline is one of the most important heterocyclic systems in life sciences.
  Some derivatives are normal metabolites, and others are used as antibacterial, antimalarial,
  and anticancer agents. In this work, we describe the synthesis, physicochemical
  properties, and fluorescence features of a new 4-quinolinone fluorophore, 3-hydroxykynurenic
  acid (3-HOKA). 3-HOKA was obtained by alkoxide-induced rearrangement of ethyl isatinacetate
  followed by acidification and then alkaline hydrolysis. The fluorescent compound
  was characterized by NMR, MS, IR, and UV–Vis spectra. 3-HOKA can exist under a keto-enol
  equilibrium, but the 4-quinolinone form is the predominant tautomer. In PBS (pH
  = 7.4), the anionic keto form of 3-HOKA showed a maximum absorption at 368 nm, a
  fluorescence peak at 474 nm, and a fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF): 0.73. 3-HOKA
  is photostable and is a moderately weak oxygen generator. Viability assays on HeLa
  cells indicated that 3-HOKA did not induce significative cytotoxic effects. Under
  UV excitation, a bright blue fluorescence was selectively found in a singular body
  within the cytoplasm, a labeling pattern that suggests the possible localization
  of the probe in the centriole or related structures. Therefore, this novel fluorophore
  represents a promising prototype compound owing to its biocompatibility and potential
  biological applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd'
