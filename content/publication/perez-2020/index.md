abstract: Composites based on bentonite and chitin were prepared and its application
  for trimethoprim (TMP) adsorption from aqueous solution was investigated. Composites
  were characterized by ATR-FTIR, XRD, DSC and TGA. Characterization data revealed
  the intercalation of the chitin macromolecules into the bentonite interlayer. Several
  important parameters of TMP adsorption were explored including the composition of
  composites, pH medium, isotherms, contact time, and reused in batch experiments.
  Batch adsorption studies showed that TMP adsorption on composites increased with
  increase in bentonite content on composites and in acid medium. Langmuir adsorption
  model showed the best agreement with the experimental data used to describe adsorption
  isotherms. Langmuir isotherm indicated that the maximum adsorption capacity of TMP
  was 67 mg/g. Sectioned composite had around 100% adsorption capacity after three
  regeneration cycles. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.
