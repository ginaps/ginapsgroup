abstract: In this study, we have investigated the impact of superparamagnetic magnetite
  nanoparticle (Fe3O4) inclusion on the chitin polysaccharide structure, together
  with its surface chemistry influence on the adsorption of lysozyme (LYZ). Magnetic
  nanoparticles (MNPs) as fillers not only endow the chitin host structure with their
  physic and chemical properties but also is a straightforward tool to modify or template
  its porous structure. Indeed, scanning electron microscopy and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
  surface area measurements confirm the template effect of the MNPs on chitin. Their
  incorporation reduced the thickness of the pore wall and increased the surface area
  from chitin (34.5 m2/g) to the chitin@Fe3O4 composites (210.8 m2/g). MNPs provide
  the composite system an intrinsic magnetic moment that enables the magnetic recovery
  of the adsorbent after LYZ uptake. To characterize the magnetic composite's interaction
  with LYZ, the effect of pH on the absorptive capacities and kinetic parameters was
  examined. The results indicated that the nanocomposite presents an adsorption capacity
  of 488 mg/g of lysozyme at pH 9, being able to recover LYZ without diluting or pretreating
  the hen egg-white, leading to a 75% global yield and a purity degree &gt;99% in
  only one chromatographic step. © 2020
