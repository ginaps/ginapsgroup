abstract: 'The simultaneous adsorption of both imazalil (IMZ) and thiabendazole (TBZ)
  fungicides in a Cu 2+ -exchanged Mt was studied in this work. Kinetic studies were
  used to determine the rate law which describes the adsorption of individual fungicides
  onto the adsorbent. Adsorption isotherm of individual and combined fungicides was
  done to evaluate synergic or antagonistic effects. The Mt-Cu material considerably
  improved TBZ and/or IMZ adsorption from aqueous suspensions with respect to raw
  Mt, leading to removal efficiencies higher than 99% after 10 min of contact time
  for TBZ and IMZ C i  = 15 and 40 mg/L, respectively, when a solid dosage = 1 g/L
  was used. The adsorption sites involved were determined by a combination of X-ray
  diffraction (XRD) determinations and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), indicating
  that fungicides were bonded to Cu 2+ cations, while the rate limiting step was the
  formation of coordination bonds. The adsorption mechanism proposed is that of ligand
  exchange between water and fungicide molecules in the metal coordination sphere.
  The single-crystal structure for the IMZ-Cu 2+ complex indicated that four molecules
  were bounded to the copper centers, while two molecules of TBZ are bounded to copper
  explaining the higher IMZ uptake capacity for the Mt-Cu material. [Figure not available:
