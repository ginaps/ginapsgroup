abstract: A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was surface-modified with carbon quantum
  dots (CQDs) and applied for the effective enhancement of the electrochemical signal
  for dopamine and uric acid determination. CQDs were prepared from graphite by a
  green modification of the Hummers method. They were characterized by FTIR-ATR, XPS,
  solid-state NMR, fluorescence and Raman spectroscopies. TPD-MS analysis was applied
  to characterize the functionalization of the surface. The CQDs were assembled on
  the glassy carbon electrode by adsorption because of the large number of carboxy
  groups on their surface warrants effective adsorption. The modified GCE exhibits
  a sensitivity that is almost 10 times better than of the bare GCE. The lower limits
  of detection are 1.3 μM for uric acid and 2.7 μM for dopamine. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.
