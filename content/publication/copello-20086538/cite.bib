 abstract = {The generation of layer-by-layer silicate-chitosan composite biosorbent was studied. The films were evaluated on its stability regarding the polymer leakage and its capability in the removal of Cd(II), Cr(III) and Cr(VI) from an aqueous solution. SEM, EDAX and ATR-IR techniques were applied for material characterization. Silicate-chitosan films with a final layer of silicate demonstrated chitosan retention and had better sorption capacities than those without it. For metal species, such as Cd(II) and Cr(III), the greatest adsorption was obtained when the pH of the solution was 7. When Cr(VI) was evaluated, pH 4 was the optimal for its adsorption. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were modeled for the equilibrium data. An 80% of the adsorbed metal was recovered by HNO3 incubation. This non-covalent immobilization method allowed chitosan surface retention and did not affect its adsorption properties. The use of a coated surface would facilitate sorbent removal from medium after adsorption. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
