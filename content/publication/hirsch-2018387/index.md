abstract: A cation exchange matrix with zwitterionic and multimodal properties was
  synthesized by a simple reaction sequence coupling sulfanilic acid to a chitosan
  based support. The novel chromatographic matrix was physico-chemically characterized
  by ss-NMR and ζ potential, and its chromatographic performance was evaluated for
  lysozyme purification from diluted egg white. The maximum adsorption capacity, calculated
  according to Langmuir adsorption isotherm, was 50.07 ± 1.47 mg g−1 while the dissociation
  constant was 0.074 ± 0.012 mg mL−1. The process for lysozyme purification from egg
  white was optimized, with 81.9% yield and a purity degree of 86.5%, according to
  RP-HPLC analysis. This work shows novel possible applications of chitosan based
  materials. The simple synthesis reactions combined with the simple mode of use of
  the chitosan matrix represents a novel method to purify proteins from raw starting
  materials. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol. Prog., 34:387–396,
