abstract: Yerba mate is the most popular tea-like beverage of South America. Consequently,
  there is a huge generation of residues of exhausted yerba mate and these may be
  used for removal of metals. The capability of exhausted yerba mate leaves in the
  removal of metals was evaluated in this study. The greatest adsorption was found
  to be at pHs below 5 and the adsorption capacity was 12.28, 11.77 and 8.80 mg g-1
  for Pb(II), Cr(III) and Cr(VI), respectively. ©2011 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.
