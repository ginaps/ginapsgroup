abstract: Novel soluble and non-soluble polymers based on methacrylic acid, ethylene
  glycol diglycidyl ether and pyrazole, triazole or imidazole were obtained by a one-spot
  synthetic strategy. The new materials were characterized by spectroscopic techniques
  (FT-IR, and solution- and solid-state NMR). Evidence on the covalent binding of
  the different heterocycles to the non-soluble matrix was given by the unequivocal
  assignment of the 13C solid-state NMR spectra. Proton relaxation times in the rotating
  frame and two-dimensional wideline separation (1H-13C WISE) NMR spectra were used
  to assess their molecular dynamics. The higher synthetic yield of polyampholytes
  bearing triazole or pyrazole correlated with a lower molecular motion and a higher
  cross-linking degree. The polyelectrolyte effect of these materials was exhaustively
  explored through the acid-base properties, swelling and zeta potential. The quaternization
  of heterocyclic residues, responsible for adsorptive properties, was studied taking
  into account that these materials are attractive for analytical, environmental and
  biotechnological processes. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
