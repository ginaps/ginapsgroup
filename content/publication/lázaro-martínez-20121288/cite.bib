 abstract = {Novel soluble and non-soluble polymers based on methacrylic acid, ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether and pyrazole, triazole or imidazole were obtained by a one-spot synthetic strategy. The new materials were characterized by spectroscopic techniques (FT-IR, and solution- and solid-state NMR). Evidence on the covalent binding of the different heterocycles to the non-soluble matrix was given by the unequivocal assignment of the 13C solid-state NMR spectra. Proton relaxation times in the rotating frame and two-dimensional wideline separation (1H-13C WISE) NMR spectra were used to assess their molecular dynamics. The higher synthetic yield of polyampholytes bearing triazole or pyrazole correlated with a lower molecular motion and a higher cross-linking degree. The polyelectrolyte effect of these materials was exhaustively explored through the acid-base properties, swelling and zeta potential. The quaternization of heterocyclic residues, responsible for adsorptive properties, was studied taking into account that these materials are attractive for analytical, environmental and biotechnological processes. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},
