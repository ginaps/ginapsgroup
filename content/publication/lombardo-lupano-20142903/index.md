abstract: Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of a hydrogel based on
  ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (EGDE) and 1,8-diamino-3,6-dioxaoctane (DA). Chemically
  stable Co(II) and Cu(II) coordination complexes were prepared with this nonsoluble
  polyelectrolyte, poly(EGDE-DA), and studied by ss-NMR, FT-IR, thermogravimetry,
  and microscopy. Mesopores were found in all the samples, the thermal stability of
  the polymer matrix was highly affected by the presence of metal ions, and the 13C
  CP-MAS spectrum for the Cu(II)-complex evidenced a significant increase in the reticulation
  degree by Cu(II) ions. The catalytic activity of these materials on H2O2 activation
  was studied by electron spin resonance (ESR). The Co(II)-poly(EGDE-DA)/H 2O2 heterogeneous
  system produced O2, an anion superoxide (O2•̄), and a hydroxyl radical (OH•), which
  diffused into the solution at the time that a decrease in pH was detected. In the
  same way, the Cu(II)-poly(EGDE-DA)/H 2O2 heterogeneous system produced O2 and OH•.
  H2O2 activation by the poly(EGDE-DA) complexes with Co(II) and Cu(II) were applied
  on the decolorization of solutions of the azo-dye methyl orange (MO). In the presence
  of 63 mM H2O 2, 87% of MO was removed in 10 min with Cu(II)-poly(EGDE-DA) and in
  110 min with Co(II)-poly(EGDE-DA). In addition, the pharmaceutical product epinephrine
  was partially oxidized to adrenochrome by the O2 •̄ released from the Co(II)-poly(EGDE-DA)/H
  2O2 heterogeneous system. © 2014 American Chemical Society.
