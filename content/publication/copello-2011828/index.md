abstract: In this work, an all the way green analytical procedure based on a silicon
  oxide film-solid phase extraction system is proposed for lead traces determination.
  From the synthesis of a solid phase extraction (SPE) system and throughout the metal
  preconcentration and determination only aqueous media were employed. Characterisation
  of the film was carried out by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Attenuated Total
  Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. Preconcentration conditions,
  prior to Pb(II) Electrothermal Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (ETAAS) determination,
  such as adsorption and desorption time, pH and temperature, were optimised. Langmuir,
  Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm models were analysed along with the
  evaluation of adsorption energy and standard free energy (ΔG 0). The greatest adsorption
  was obtained with incubation at pH 7 and 37°C. By using a small volume of 0.5 mol
  L -1 HNO 3 (0.5 mL) lead was desorbed from the silicon oxide film after 2 h incubation,
  generating low amount of waste. The films showed better adjustment for the Langmuir
  model (R 2=0.989). The detection limit (3.29δ) for Pb(II) was 0.228 μgL -1. The
  developed procedure is 10-fold more sensitive in comparison to direct ETAAS determination.
  Recovery values from soft tap-water and soft well-water were above 95%. When hard
  water was analysed, Pb(II) adsorption was found to be interfered by Mg 2+ and Ca
  2+. After five preconcentration cycles relative recovery was found not to decay
  below 90%, indicating that the silicon oxide film could be used for multiple lead
  determinations. © 2011 Taylor &amp; Francis.
