abstract: 'An ion exchange resin was designed by combining different ratios of ethylene
  glycol diglycidyl ether (EGDE) and imidazole (IM). The aim of the research was to
  obtain in a single step a resin with permanent positive charges. The strategy was
  to use the IM in a dual way, first as a curing agent during the synthesis and as
  carrier of the permanentpositive charge in the final product. This novel procedure
  avoid further modification of the resin, reducing time and cost of production. The
  material with 1:0.3 EGDE:IM molar ratio achieved high adsorption capacity for the
  textile dye, Remazol Black B (qmax: 1.33 × 103 mg g-1) and good performance in a
  continuous adsorption system. The water uptake was 592% and pH independent. 1H-NMR
  confirmed the covalent binding of IM to the polyelectrolyte chain, and the FTIR
  results evidenced epoxy opening. The shielding of the positive charge resulting
  from the electrostatic interaction of this polyelectrolyte with Remazol Black B
  induced some degree of chain shrinkage, according to SEM images and to the visual
  inspection. In the attempt to optimize the performance of the fixed bed adsorption
  system an experimental design was carried out. The multilinear regression model
  allowed the acquisition of a deeper knowledge of the experimental space and opening
  the way to further improvement of the process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.'
