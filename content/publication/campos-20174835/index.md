abstract: In this work carbon quantum dot (CQD) nanoparticles are synthesized from
  d-lactose using a hydrothermal method and then they are coated with polyethylene
  glycol (CQDs@PEG). These particles exhibit a monodisperse spherical morphology with
  an average particle size of ∼4 nm. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier
  transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed the presence of the hydroxyl groups
  from the ethylene glycol molecules grafted onto the CQDs' surfaces, which confirms
  that PEG was covalently attached to the nanoparticles' surfaces. Fluorescence analysis
  demonstrates a shift in the emission at 495 nm after PEG coating. Modified carbon
  dots were introduced into thermo-responsive pNIPAM microgels. The resultant pNIPAM-CQDs@PEG
  hybrid system exhibits interesting fluorescence properties. Transmission electron
  microscopy (TEM), fluorescence microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy
  confirm the incorporation of CQD particles into the microgels. Finally, dynamic
  light scattering (DLS) analysis confirms that further hybrid microgels based on
  pNIPAM are thermo-responsive, with a transition temperature similar to that of a
  system with an ionic component. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre
