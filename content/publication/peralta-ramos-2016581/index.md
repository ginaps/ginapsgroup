abstract: In this work chitin hydrogels were reinforced with TiO2 nanoparticles acting
  as fillers. The mechanical and physicochemical characteristics of these hydrogels
  were studied by oscillatory rheology, infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron
  Microscopy (SEM) and Small Angle X-ray Spectroscopy (SAXS). Adsorption showed to
  be higher at pHs below the TiO2 point of zero charge (pH≈6.9). The equilibrium was
  achieved within 4h following an Elovich kinetic model. The equilibrium assay showed
  a maximum capacity of 3.1mg/g with better fitting for the Langmuir model. Moreover,
  the homogeneity/heterogeneity parameters of the Sips, Toth and Redlich-Peterson
  models were close to a value of 1, indicating a homogeneous sorbent/sorbate interaction.
  Typical natural water ions competed with As(V) for the sorption sites, being sulfate
  the most relevant interference. This interference was also evidenced in As(V) adsorption
  from natural water samples where the sorption capacity varied depending the anion
  composition of the sample. The reutilization of the hybrid gel was assessed up to
  five adsorption cycles. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
