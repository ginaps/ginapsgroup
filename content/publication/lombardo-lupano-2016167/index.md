abstract: The synthesis of non-soluble polyampholytes was modified to obtain water-soluble
  oligomers, by a sequential reaction at 60 °C of imidazole (IM), ethyleneglycol diglycidyl
  ether (EGDE) and methacrylic acid (MAA). The hydrogel Poly(EGDE-IM) with disubstituted
  imidazole (IM+) residues, enhanced its solubility in water by functionalization
  with Poly(MAA). NMR and mass spectrometry evidenced ester groups, Poly(MAA) chains,
  Poly(EGDE), and IM+ links. Capillary electrophoresis evidenced populations with
  positive net charge at pH lower than 9, due to IM+ and protonatable residues (IMH+).
  Water-soluble aggregates of oligomers were detected by size exclusion chromatography.
  The product aggregated with cations such as Fe(II) adsorbing anionic compounds,
  and formed hollow spheres when citric acid was present. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag
