abstract: Antimicrobial finishings protect users from pathogenic and odor-generating
  microorganisms, which are of medical and hygiene concerns. Controlled release is
  a useful approach to obtain antimicrobial finishings in several materials because
  it provides a gradual and persistent antibiotic release from the surface into the
  surroundings. Such a property has been taken into account in this work, using chitin
  nano-whiskers (CNWs) as carriers of methylparaben to prepare durable antimicrobial
  cotton textiles. This durability has been endowed with fixing CNWs in a silicon
  oxide matrix. Antimicrobial activity has been determined using Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
  Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumanii and Salmonella choleraesuis.
  Treated textiles have shown antimicrobial activity with laundering durability up
  to 20 washing cycles. Methylparaben leaching from the textile has been assessed
  by liquid chromatography showing a methylparaben controlled release which could
  be responsible for the obtained antimicrobial laundry durability. Textile mechanical
  properties have not been altered by the finishing. © The Royal Society of Chemistry
