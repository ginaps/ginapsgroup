abstract: The aim of this work was to study the functionality and quantitative level
  of recombinant protein produced from bacteria immobilized and preserved in sol-gel
  matrices. Matrices prepared from two precursors, silicon dioxide and tetraethoxysilane,
  were studied. In previous works we analyzed the number of viable cells and level
  of recombinant protein production from cultures started with immobilized Escherichia
  coli, stored in sealed tubes at 4 and 20 °C. We observed that the amount of bacteria
  in silicon dioxide derived matrix conserved in the same order of magnitude as before
  immobilization, during 2 months, but those in an alkoxide derived matrix decrease
  until no viable cells were detected at both 4 and 20 °C after 42 days. In this work,
  immobilized bacteria were used as culture starter to produce recombinant proteins
  with a yield comparable with glycerol stocks. T-cell proliferation and gel filtration
  assays suggest that SAgs produced from cultures started with sol-gel immobilized
  bacteria retain their biological activity. Affinity assays using a resonant biosensor
  showed that Streptococcal Superantigen (SSA) has affinity for human Vβ5.2 produced
  from sol-gel immobilized bacteria with KD = 7.5 μM. These results contribute to
  the development of methods for microbial cells preservation under field conditions.
