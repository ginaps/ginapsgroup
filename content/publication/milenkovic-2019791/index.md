abstract: Carbon Dots (CDs) were obtained using a hydrothermal method and used for
  the detection of fingerprints through fluorescent imaging. Synthesized CDs exhibited
  a brightness emission at 495 nm, which was related to their structural and chemical
  properties. The results of detailed surface characterizations by XPS, ss-NMR and
  fluorescence spectroscopies, suggested that the negative charge of the functionals
  groups promoted electrostatic interactions between the charged CDs surface functional
  groups (amine, amide and carboxylic) and the secretion components present in the
  thin layer of fluid left on the surface upon its direct contact with human fingers.
  The obtained results were validated by the scientific protocol of the Police Automated
  Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) based on a biometric identification. ©
