abstract: Previous studies by our group demonstrated the key role of iron in Schwann
  cell maturation through an increase in cAMP, PKA activation and CREB phosphorylation.
  These studies opened the door to further research on non-transferrin-bound iron
  uptake, which revealed the presence of DMT1 mRNA all along SC progeny, hinting at
  a constitutive role of DMT1 in ensuring the provision of iron in the PNS. In light
  of these previous results, the present work evaluates the participation of DMT1
  in the remyelination process following a demyelinating lesion promoted by sciatic
  nerve crush - a reversible model of Wallerian degeneration. DMT1 was observed to
  colocalize with a SC marker S100β at all survival times analyzed. In turn, the assessment
  of DMT1 mRNA expression exhibited an increase 7 days post-injury, while DMT1 protein
  levels showed an increase 14 days after crush at the lesion site and distal stump;
  finally, an increase in iron levels became evident as from 14 days post-injury,
  in parallel with DMT1 values. To sum up, the present work unveils the role of DMT1
  in mediating the neuroregenerative action of iron. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.
