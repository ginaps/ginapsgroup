abstract: The chlorophyllide b derivatized polyallylamine (PAAChl) was synthesized.
  The resulting fluorescent polymer presented a high emission quantum yield, very
  stable in time. The polymer formed a hydrogel when treated with carbon dioxide that
  was characterized by Raman spectroscopy and solid-state NMR (ss-NMR). The adsorption
  of CO2 took place through the formation of carbamate. Absorbance and fluorescence
  based analytical studies were performed. The UV–vis spectra of PAAChl, after additions
  of CO2, showed a growing absorption peak at 250 nm corresponding to carbamate formation.
  The emission of fluorescence at 664 nm as function of carbon dioxide concentrations
  showed a linear regression with a detection limit of 2 ppm and a quantification
  limit of 5 ppm. The capacity of a chemical sensor is described by sensibility, selectivity,
  stability; response time and regeneration were also analyzed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.
