abstract: Linear poly(ethylenimine hydrochloride) (PEI·HCl) polymers with different
  molecular weights (22, 87, and 217 kDa) and their copper complexes (Cu-PEI) were
  studied with particular attention to the crystalline/amorphous character of the
  polymeric chains in lyophilized and crystallized samples by using 1D and 2D solid-state
  nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction
  techniques. Different 13C1H cross-polarization and magic angle spinning experiments
  using delayed contact time, 1H dipolar filter and 1H spin-lock filter were crucial
  to determine the different mobility domains in the crystallized and lyophilized
  samples of PEI·HCl and Cu-PEI. 13C direct polarization experiments allowed the quantification
  of the crystalline/amorphous segments in each sample. The lyophilization process
  produced an increase in the amorphous fraction, even when some ordered domains were
  present, whereas the coordination of copper/sulfate ions produced a significant
  decrease in the mobility of polymer chains, leading to homogeneous and ordered materials
  even when Cu was desorbed. © 2015 American Chemical Society.
