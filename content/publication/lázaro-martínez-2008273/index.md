abstract: In this work we describe the application of a new non-soluble and non-porous
  complex with copper ion based on ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (EGDE), methacrylic
  acid (MAA) and 2-methylimidazole (2MI) in the decolorization of an azo dye Methyl
  Orange (MO) as a model pollutant at room temperature. The complex with copper ion
  was studied by ESR and SEM and was tested as a heterogeneous catalyst for H2O2 activation.
  A possible mechanism of interaction involves the production of hydroxyl radicals
  (confirmed by ESR), dioxygen and water. The Cu(II)-polyampholyte/H2O2 system acted
  efficiently in the color removal of MO. The adsorption and oxidative degradation
  of the azo-based dye followed pseudo-first-order kinetic profiles, and the rate
  constant for degradation had a second-order dependence on copper ion content in
  the mixture. A removal of MO higher than 90% was achieved in 20 min at pH 7.0, combining
  0.8 mM of complexed copper ions in the mixture with 24 mM hydrogen peroxide. The
  dye adsorbed on the polyampholyte following a L4-type isotherm with 4.9 μmol g-1
  maximum loading capacity and 3.1 μM dissociation constant for the first monolayer.
