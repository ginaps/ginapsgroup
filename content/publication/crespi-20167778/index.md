abstract: The gem-diol moieties of organic compounds are rarely isolated or even studied
  in the solid state. Here, liquid- and solid-state NMR, together with single-crystal
  X-ray diffraction studies, were used to show different strategies to favor the gem-diol
  or carbonyl moieties and to isolate hemiacetal structures in formylpyridine and
  vitamin-B6-related compounds. The change in position of the carbonyl group in pyridine
  compounds had a clear and direct effect on the hydration, which was enhanced by
  trifluoroacetic acid addition. Because of their biochemical importance, vitamin-B6-related
  compounds were studied with emphasis on the elucidation of the gem-diol, cyclic
  hemiacetal or carbonyl structures that can be obtained in different experimental
  conditions. In particular, new racemic mixtures for the cyclic hemiacetal structure
  from pyridoxal are reported in trifluoroacetate and hydrochloride derivatives. ©
