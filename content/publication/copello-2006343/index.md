abstract: The antimicrobial compound dodecyl-di(aminoethyl)-glycine was immobilized
  in a silicon oxide xerogel matrix and used for glass surface coating. Coated glasses
  were tested for surface antimicrobial activity. The utilization of tetraethoxysilane
  (TEOS) as a silicon oxide polymer precursor, using the dip-coating process, allowed
  for the generation of transparent thin films over glass surfaces. Different concentrations
  of the antimicrobial compound were used to generate the coatings. The presence of
  dodecyl-di(aminoethyl)-glycine on coated and uncoated slides was analyzed by FTIR
  spectra. Coated glass slides were exposed to suspensions of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas
  aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus for 24 h. Surface contamination was evaluated
  by the microbial plate count technique. When antimicrobial-coated glasses were compared
  with antimicrobial-free coated glasses, the former showed greater than 99% reduction
  of colony-forming units (cfu) for E. coli and P. aeruginosa, when 1% of antimicrobial
  was present in the coating solution. The same percentage of reduction for S. aureus
  was achieved when 1.5% of the antimicrobial was present in the coating solution.
  In a direct inhibition test on agar plates, no inhibitory zone was observed, indicating
  that the antimicrobial did not diffuse into the media. Â© Society for Industrial
