 abstract = {The antimicrobial compound dodecyl-di(aminoethyl)-glycine was immobilized in a silicon oxide xerogel matrix and used for glass surface coating. Coated glasses were tested for surface antimicrobial activity. The utilization of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as a silicon oxide polymer precursor, using the dip-coating process, allowed for the generation of transparent thin films over glass surfaces. Different concentrations of the antimicrobial compound were used to generate the coatings. The presence of dodecyl-di(aminoethyl)-glycine on coated and uncoated slides was analyzed by FTIR spectra. Coated glass slides were exposed to suspensions of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus for 24 h. Surface contamination was evaluated by the microbial plate count technique. When antimicrobial-coated glasses were compared with antimicrobial-free coated glasses, the former showed greater than 99% reduction of colony-forming units (cfu) for E. coli and P. aeruginosa, when 1% of antimicrobial was present in the coating solution. The same percentage of reduction for S. aureus was achieved when 1.5% of the antimicrobial was present in the coating solution. In a direct inhibition test on agar plates, no inhibitory zone was observed, indicating that the antimicrobial did not diffuse into the media. Â© Society for Industrial Microbiology 2005.},
