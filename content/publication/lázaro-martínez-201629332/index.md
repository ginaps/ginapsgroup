abstract: We report the performance of Co(II) and Cu(II) coordination complexes on
  H2O2 activation. The heterogeneous catalysts containing aliphatic amine, N-heterocycle,
  and/or carboxylic acid ligands in hydrogel materials coordinated with Co(II) or
  Cu(II) were used in this study. These complexes were characterized by solid-state
  NMR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray fluorescence techniques in
  order to quantify the superficial and bulk metal ion centers together with the aim
  of elucidating the ligands involved in the uptake of Co and Cu ions. The release
  of free radicals on H2O2 activation and the identity of reactive oxygen species
  were studied by spin trapping using DMPO in electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments.
  The Co(II) complex/H2O2 systems produced O2, anion superoxide (O2•-), and hydroxyl
  radical (OH•), which diffused into the solution at the time that a decrease in pH
  was detected. A possible catalytic mechanism would involve the Co(II)/Co(III) redox
  couple, according to XPS results. In the same way, the Cu(II) complex/H2O2 systems
  produced O2 and OH•, with evidence of Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox cycle. For these catalytic
  systems, there was no direct evidence of intermediary reactive species. The identity
  of the ligands played a crucial role in the efficiency of catalytic activation.
  In addition, in the absence of H2O2, the dissolved O2 was activated by most of the
  complexes tested, releasing only OH•. © 2016 American Chemical Society.
