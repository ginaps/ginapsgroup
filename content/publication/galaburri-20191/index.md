abstract: The oxidation of keratin hydrogels was optimized aiming to obtain keratose
  hydrogels while maintaining the original 3D structure and pH-responsive behaviour.
  In addition, we present a comparative study of their dual-stimuli responsive behaviour
  regarding the pH-responsiveness and their previously non-described ion selective
  responsiveness. Keratose and keratin hydrogels showed similar swellings when contracted
  at low pH, and the former showed steeper expansion and higher swelling than the
  latter at high pH. In addition, both hydrogels showed selective responsiveness toward
  Ca2+ ions when expanded, and toward Cu2+ ions when contracted. IR, Raman, ss-NMR,
  HRMAS NMR, SAXS, and thermal characterization demonstrated that oxidation does not
  interfere with the stimuli-responsive mechanisms related to protein conformation.
  The higher swelling of keratose hydrogels would be originated in the increase of
  the mobility of the chains after oxidation coupled to the hydration of sulfonic
  acid groups. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd
