abstract: The goal of this work was to investigate biophysical stability of iron-pectin
  nanoparticles and analyze the feasibility of using them as delivery systems for
  the probiotic strain Lactobacillus plantarum CIDCA 83114. Iron oxide (Fe 3 O 4 )
  nanoparticles were synthesized from 0.25M FeCl 2 /0.5 M FeCl 3 .6H 2 O, and coated
  with citrus pectins. Their physico-chemical properties [FTIR, X-ray diffraction
  (XRD), ζ-potential, particle size, SEM, TEM] and their effect on bacterial stabilization
  (viability after freeze-drying/storage, stability when exposed to simulated gastro-intestinal
  conditions) were assessed. XRD indicated the almost exclusive presence of magnetite
  crystalline phases. FTIR spectra confirmed the adsorption of pectin on magnetite
  nanoparticles surface. SEM and TEM images evidenced agglomerated nanoparticles,
  and a morphological surface change after adsorption of pectin. DLS and ζ-potential
  results proved the solvation of the ionizable groups in the hydrophilic network
  which induced chain expansion and agglomeration. Iron from nanoparticles demonstrated
  to be non-toxic for microorganisms up to 1.00 mg/mL. Simulated saliva and gastric
  solutions prevented nanoparticles from dissolution. The higher pH of the intestinal
  conditions (solvated -COO- and Fe-O- groups) facilitated the dispersion and partial
  dissolution of nanoparticles. Pectins adsorption on magnetite nanoparticles significantly
  enhanced electrostatic repulsion, which aided the solvation of ionized iron forms.
  The soluble species diffused out from the aggregates, being detected in the simulated
  intestinal fluid. Regarding bacterial viability, no decays were observed neither
  when pectin-decorated nanoparticles were exposed to simulated fluids nor when stored
  at 4 °C for 60 days. The composites engineered in this work appear as adequate delivery
  systems for probiotic bacteria, whose target is the gut. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.
