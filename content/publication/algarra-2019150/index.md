abstract: A simple, fast, and laboratory efficient doped P carbon nanoparticles synthesis
  is developed for fingerprint imaging, using 1,3-dihydroxyacetone and di-phosphorous
  pentoxide. Fluorescence nanoparticles, with an average size of 230 nm were obtained,
  without additional energy input or external heating. ATR, solid NMR, XPS and fluorescence
  spectroscopy revealed their surface functionalization; a reaction mechanism is proposed.
  Fluorescence measurements exhibited a maximum emission band at ca. 495 nm, when
  excited at 385 nm. The images obtained, on different surfaces such as mobile telephone
  screen, magnetic band and metallic surface of a credit card and a Euro banknote
  treated with the obtained nano-powders allows us to record positive matches, confirming
  that the experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of proposed method. ©
