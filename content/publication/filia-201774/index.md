abstract: Safety concerns for fetus development of zidovudine (AZT) administration
  as prophylaxis of vertical transmission of HIV persist. We evaluated the participation
  of the ATP-binding cassette efflux transporter ABCG2 in the penetration of AZT into
  the fetal brain and the relevance for drug safety. Oral daily doses of AZT (60 mg/kg
  body weight) or its vehicle were administered between post gestational days 11 (E11)
  and 20 (E20) to Sprague-Dawley pregnant rats. At E21, animals received an intravenous
  bolus of 60 mg AZT/kg body weight in the presence or absence of the ABCG2 inhibitor
  gefitinib (20 mg/kg body weight, ip) and AZT in maternal plasma and fetal brain
  were measured by HPLC-UV. ABCG2 protein expression in placenta and fetal brain,
  as well as mitochondrial function and ultrastructure in fetal brain were also analyzed.
  In utero chronic exposure to AZT markedly induced ABCG2 expression in placenta and
  fetal brain whereas did not significantly alter mitochondrial functionality in the
  fetal brain. The area-under-the-concentration-time-curve of AZT significantly decreased
  in fetal brains isolated from AZT-exposed fetuses compared to control group, but
  this effect was abolished by ABCG2 inhibition. Our results suggest that the absence
  of mitochondrial toxicity in the fetal brain after chronic in utero administration
  of AZT could be attributed to its low accumulation in the tissue caused, at least
  in part, by ABCG2 overexpression. We propose that any interference with ABCG2 activity
  due to genetic, pathological or iatrogenic factors would increase the amount of
  AZT reaching the fetal brain, which could increase the risk of toxicity of this
  drug on the tissue. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.
