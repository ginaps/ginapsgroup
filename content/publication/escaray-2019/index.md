abstract: Forage legumes are an important livestock nutritional resource, which includes
  essential metals, such as copper. Particularly, the high prevalence of hypocuprosis
  causes important economic losses to Argentinian cattle agrosystems. Copper deficiency
  in cattle is partially due to its low content in forage produced by natural grassland,
  and is exacerbated by flooding conditions. Previous results indicated that incorporation
  of Lotus spp. into natural grassland increases forage nutritional quality, including
  higher copper levels. However, the biological processes and molecular mechanisms
  involved in copper uptake by Lotus spp. remain poorly understood. Here, we identify
  four genes that encode putative members of the Lotus copper transporter family,
  denoted COPT in higher plants. A heterologous functional complementation assay of
  the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ctr1∆ctr3∆ strain, which lacks the corresponding yeast
  copper transporters, with the putative Lotus COPT proteins shows a partial rescue
  of the yeast phenotypes in restrictive media. Under partial submergence conditions,
  the copper content of L. japonicus plants decreases and the expression of two Lotus
  COPT genes is induced. These results strongly suggest that the Lotus COPT proteins
  identified in this work function in copper uptake. In addition, the fact that environmental
  conditions affect the expression of certain COPT genes supports their involvement
  in adaptive mechanisms and envisages putative biotechnological strategies to improve
  cattle copper nutrition. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.
