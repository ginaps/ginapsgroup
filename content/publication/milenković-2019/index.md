abstract: Reports about the influence of cerium-oxide nanoparticles (nCeO2) on plants
  are contradictory due to their positive and negative effects on plants. Surface
  modification may affect the interaction of nCeO2 with the environment, and hence
  its availability to plants. In this study, the uncoated and glucose-, levan-, and
  pullulan-coated nCeO2 were synthesized and characterized. The aim was to determine
  whether nontoxic carbohydrates alter the effect of nCeO2 on the seed germination,
  plant growth, and metabolism of wheat and pea. We applied 200 mgL-1 of nCeO2 on
  plants during germination (Ger treatment) or three week-growth (Gro treatment) in
  hydroponics. The plant response to nCeO2 was studied by measuring changes in Ce
  concentration, total antioxidative activity (TAA), total phenolic content (TPC),
  and phenolic profile. Our results generally revealed higher Ce concentration in
  plants after the treatment with coated nanoparticles compared to uncoated ones.
  Considering all obtained results, Ger treatment had a stronger impact on the later
  stages of plant development than Gro treatment. The Ger treatment had a stronger
  impact on TPC and plant elongation, whereas Gro treatment affected more TAA and
  phenolic profile. Among nanoparticles, levan-coated nCeO2 had the strongest and
  positive impact on tested plants. Wheat showed higher sensitivity to all treatments.
