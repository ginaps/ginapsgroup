abstract: 'This work presents the synthesis of chitin (Chi) and chitin/graphene oxide
  (Chi:nGO) hybrid gels in mild conditions and their use as biosorbents in solid-liquid
  batch systems. The graphene oxide nanosheets, obtained from natural graphite through
  Hummers method, were characterized using FT-IR, ESR and pHpzc determination as a
  qualitative approach of the degree of exfoliation and oxidation. Two kinds of widely
  used dyes were tested: Remazol Black (RB) as an acid dye model and Neutral Red (NR)
  as a basic dye model. Adsorption assays results were analyzed using two and three
  parameters isotherm models. The maximum adsorption capacity (qm) for RB and NR were
  9.3×10-2mmol/g and 57×10-2mmol/g being the first one reached by Chi and the second
  by the hybrid. Furthermore, the adsorption behavior over the time was evaluated
  through pseudo-first, pseudo-second, Elovich and Modified Freundlich models being
  the first one which described better all the cases except the adsorption of Remazol
  Black on chitin gel which follows an Elovich tendency. According to the pseudo-first
  order model, the uptake rates (k1) were between 1.1×10-2min-1 and 1.4×10-2min-1,
  but for the Chi:nGO-NR system it was 1.7×10-3min-1. The adsorption was observed
  to be dependent on both the solution pH and the Chi:nGO proportion. Finally, both
  dyes can be desorbed from both kinds of materials up to 60% of the sorbed amount
  by increasing the solution pH above 8. This would imply the capability of reutilization
  of the material with minor sorption capacity. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..'
