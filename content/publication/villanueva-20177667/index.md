abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate phosphorus removal in water by
  using a polyampholyte obtained by the reaction of methacrylic acid, ethylene glycol
  diglycidyl ether and imidazole by a one step synthesis, mixed with diatomaceous
  earth. The material was characterized before and after phosphorus exposure using
  FT-IR, Raman, and solid state 31P-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy concluding that the
  charged imidazole units were involved in the interaction between the phosphorus
  and the polyampholyte and that only the H2PO4- species was adsorbed. The point of
  zero charge value was 5.09. Concomitantly, the optimal pH for P adsorption was 5.0.
  As pH was increased, the polymer turned more negative, and the phosphate repulsion
  diminished the adsorption. In the batch experiments, the adsorption isotherms at
  pH values 5.0 and 7.0 were studied. The effects of different flow rates, P influent
  concentration and the interference of nitrate and sulfate in the breakthrough curves
  were studied. A shorter breakthrough time occurred at a higher flow rate. The q0
  values not only increased from lower to higher influent levels but also showed a
  decrease in the presence of S and N as interferents demonstrating that there was
  a competition for the adsorption sites between those anions and the phosphate. ©
