abstract: This study is a preliminary approach to develop novel montmorillonite (Mt)
  based adsorbents for removing inorganic and organic contaminants in a step-like
  process. Biomass (fungi) and surfactant (octadecyltrimethylammonium bromide) modified
  montmorillonites (BMt and OMt, respectively) were obtained. In a prior step, Cu2+
  was loaded into Mt, BMt and OMt. In a second step, the materials (Mt, Mt-Cu, BMt,
  BMt-Cu, OMt, OMt-Cu) were used as thiabendazole (TBZ) adsorbents. TBZ adsorption
  isotherms were performed, and Langmuir, Freundlich and Langmuir-Freundlich mathematical
  models were evaluated. TBZ removal efficiency of the materials was also tested using
  three adsorbent dosages. The adsorbents and TBZ-adsorbed products were characterized
  by X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis, and by electron paramagnetic resonance
  (EPR) and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance measurements (ss-NMR). To determine
  the subsequent arrangement of the adsorption products, leaching experiments were
  also conducted. In the BMt sample, TBZ adsorption was enhanced compared to the raw
  Mt sample. An opposite behaviour was observed for OMt samples. All the Cu2+-loaded
  materials showed better TBZ removal efficiencies than the same materials without
  Cu2+. Furthermore, Cu2+ chelation through the imidazolic and thiazolic nitrogen
  atoms of TBZ in all Cu2+-loaded samples allowed TBZ and Cu2+ to be resistant to
  migration in environmental leaching conditions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.
