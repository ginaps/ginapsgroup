abstract: In this work, we describe the Cu2+ ion uptake from recently developed hydrogel
  with polyampholyte and polyelectrolyte behavior at different concentrations of the
  metal ion. Solid-state NMR and EPR were used as complementary techniques to understand
  the coordination role of carboxylic acid and azole groups (imidazole, triazole and
  pyrazole) involved in the copper ion coordination. In polymers containing imidazole
  and triazole, the uptake took place preferentially through the azole groups, with
  less participation of the carboxylate groups at low concentrations of Cu2+. However,
  as the concentration of Cu2+ increased, these azole ligands became less active in
  the new sites for copper. In polymers containing pyrazole, coordination of Cu2+
  was through both carboxylate and pyrazole ligands, regardless of the concentration
  of Cu2+. Interactions of the different ligands in the networks and the structural
  changes produced by copper ions (Cu1+, Cu2+) were characterized by thermal and NMR
  measurements. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
