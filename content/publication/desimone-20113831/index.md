abstract: Hybrid and nanocomposite silica-collagen materials derived from concentrated
  collagen hydrogels were evaluated in vitro and in vivo to establish their potentialities
  for biological dressings. Silicification significantly improved the mechanical and
  thermal stability of the collagen network within the hybrid systems. Nanocomposites
  were found to favor the metabolic activity of immobilized human dermal fibroblasts
  while decreasing the hydrogel contraction. Cell adhesion experiments suggested that
  in vitro cell behavior was dictated by mechanical properties and surface structure
  of the scaffold. First-to-date in vivo implantation of bulk hydrogels in subcutaneous
  sites of rats was performed over the vascular inflammatory period. These materials
  were colonized and vascularized without inducing strong inflammatory response. These
  data raise reasonable hope for the future application of silica-collagen biomaterials
  as biological dressings. © 2011 American Chemical Society.
