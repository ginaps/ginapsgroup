 abstract = {Nanocomposites and hybrid materials of Ag-1,3,5- benzenetricarboxylic acid metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with Sand N-carbon quantum dots (CQDs) were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity against representative Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacterial strains using the qualitative disk-diffusion approach and the quantitative minimum inhibitory concentration test. The composites and hybrids were found to be nontoxic to living cells. The composite formation fostered a synergistic effect that enhanced their antibacterial activity compared with those of their pristine components. Charge transfer from AgMOF to CQDs facilitated the electrostatic interactions of the composites and hybrids with the bacterial cell membranes. Enhanced bactericidal activity was linked to morphological features (a nanorod-like morphology) and specific surface chemistry. The latter affected the release of silver. Silver on the surface of the MOFs rather than silver in the bulk was found to be important. The destruction of the MOF component in the extracellular environment led to the release of silver ions, which have a high affinity to S compounds of the cell physiology. The formation of metallic silver (Ago) and silver sulfides (Ag2S) was suggested as essential for the ability of the composites and hybrids to inhibit bacterial growth. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that introduces the bactericidal effect of AgMOF-CQDs composites and hybrids. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},
