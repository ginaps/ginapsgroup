abstract: Nanocomposites and hybrid materials of Ag-1,3,5- benzenetricarboxylic acid
  metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with Sand N-carbon quantum dots (CQDs) were synthesized
  and evaluated for their antibacterial activity against representative Gram-positive
  (Bacillus subtilis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacterial strains using
  the qualitative disk-diffusion approach and the quantitative minimum inhibitory
  concentration test. The composites and hybrids were found to be nontoxic to living
  cells. The composite formation fostered a synergistic effect that enhanced their
  antibacterial activity compared with those of their pristine components. Charge
  transfer from AgMOF to CQDs facilitated the electrostatic interactions of the composites
  and hybrids with the bacterial cell membranes. Enhanced bactericidal activity was
  linked to morphological features (a nanorod-like morphology) and specific surface
  chemistry. The latter affected the release of silver. Silver on the surface of the
  MOFs rather than silver in the bulk was found to be important. The destruction of
  the MOF component in the extracellular environment led to the release of silver
  ions, which have a high affinity to S compounds of the cell physiology. The formation
  of metallic silver (Ago) and silver sulfides (Ag2S) was suggested as essential for
  the ability of the composites and hybrids to inhibit bacterial growth. To the best
  of our knowledge, this is the first study that introduces the bactericidal effect
  of AgMOF-CQDs composites and hybrids. © 2018 American Chemical Society.
