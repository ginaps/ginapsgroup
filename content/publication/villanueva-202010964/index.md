abstract: Trimethoprim is an emerging pollutant that has been found in ground water
  in alarming concentrations. Thus, the development of economical and efficient advanced
  water treatment technologies is crucially needed. In this paper, a keratin hydrogel
  with immersed TiO2 nanoparticles (nTiO2) was developed. The material was characterized
  by using FT-IR and FT-Raman spectroscopies that showed that a physical interaction
  between nTiO2 and the keratin hydrogel took place. Dielectric spectroscopy confirmed
  the influence of this interaction on the keratin structure. Swelling studies showed
  that it depended on the medium pH, being higher at basic pH values. Photocurrent
  measurements revealed an enhanced photocurrent of the hydrogels, which may be due
  to the improved transport of the photogenerated carriers via the porous network
  structure. The model pollutant was trimethoprim, an emerging pollutant. These hydrogels
  showed the ability to adsorb and degrade trimethoprim in the presence of simulated
  solar light under batch conditions for at least four cycles with no significant
  decrease in efficiency. Experimental variables (time, temperature, and pH) were
  studied in order to characterize the material adsorption and photodegradation performance,
  concluding that temperature is the main variable to consider in the adsorption process.
