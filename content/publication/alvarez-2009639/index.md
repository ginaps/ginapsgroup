abstract: Immobilized bacteria are being extensively used for metabolite production,
  biocatalysts, and biosensor construction. However, long-term viability and metabolic
  activity of entrapped bacteria is affected by several conditions such as their physiological
  state, the presence of high-osmolarity environments, porous structure and shrinkage
  of the matrix. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of various parameters
  on bacteria immobilized in sol-gel-derived silica matrices. With this purpose, we
  evaluated the stress of immobilization over bacteria cultures obtained from different
  growing states, the effect of cell density and bacteria capability to proliferate
  inside matrices. Best results to attain longer preservation times were obtained
  when we immobilized suspensions with an optimized bacterial number of 1∈×∈107 cfu/gel
  in the presence of LB medium using aqueous silica precursors. Furthermore, the impact
  of osmotic stress with the subsequent intracellular trehalose accumulation and the
  addition of osmolites were investigated. Shorter preservation times were found for
  bacteria immobilized in the presence of osmolites while trehalose accumulation in
  stressed cells did not produce changes on entrapped bacteria viability. Finally,
  nutrient addition in silica matrices was studied indicating that the presence of
  a carbon source without the simultaneous addition of nitrogen was detrimental for
  immobilized E. coli. However, when both carbon and nitrogen sources were present,
  bacteria were able to survive longer periods of time. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.
