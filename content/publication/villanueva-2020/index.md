abstract: The development of composite materials consisting of metal nanoparticles
  embedded in macromolecular compounds, obtained via in-situ reduction process has
  attracted research interest. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been synthesized
  by a one-step method at 25 °C, that involves photo-reduction of AgNO3 dissolved
  in a solution of oligomers which promoted Ag∘ generation. These highly functionalized
  oligomers, obtained from ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (EGDE), imidazole and
  methacrylic acid, were tested as reagents in photo-reduction/NP stabilization. Their
  functional groups acted as ligands on coordinating Ag+ and then stabilizing AgNPs,
  being particularly involved ether function of EGDE, according to DLS and FT-IR evidence.
  These organic macromolecules strongly promoted the adherence of AgNP-oligomers structures
  to polystyrene substrate. The composite materials were further characterized by
  UV–visible spectroscopy, electrochemical methods, SEM and TEM. The antimicrobial
  activity of the polystyrene surface modified with AgNP-oligomers was studied, concluding
  that it had biocidal activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria.
