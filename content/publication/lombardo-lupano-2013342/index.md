abstract: A new catalyst based on Co(II) and a hydrogel with property of polyampholyte
  was characterized by equilibrium studies of Co(II) uptake, solid-state NMR and energy
  dispersive X-ray analysis. The matrix derived from methacrylic acid and 2-methylimidazole
  is easily synthesized in one-spot strategy, and combines coordination properties
  with chemical resistance. The catalytic activity of this material on H2O2 activation
  was studied by electron spin resonance, which confirmed the release of superoxide
  radical. A possible mechanism of interaction involves the simultaneous production
  of dioxygen, protons and water. The catalytic performance was assessed in the activation
  of H2O2 for the oxidation of two representative organic compounds of environmental
  concern. About 70% of methyl orange, a model azo dye, was removed from distilled
  water in 2 h by oxidation with H2O2 60 mM and by adsorption on the catalyst. The
  amount of adsorbed dye was minimized in the presence of 0.1 M Na2SO4. The kinetics
  of the processes followed a pseudo-first-order empirical model, and the catalyst
  was recovered and re-used. Epinephrine was chosen as a pharmaceutical model susceptible
  to superoxide attack. About 80% of conversion to adrenochrome was reached in less
  than 6 min, following a pseudo-first-order kinetic model. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All
