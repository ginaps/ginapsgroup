abstract: Geminal diols or gem-diols are the product of the addition of water to a
  carbonyl group of either an aldehyde or a ketone. These compounds are rarely stable
  and seldom found in the liquid or solid state since the moisture balance is largely
  dependent on the structure. However, the family of organic chemical compounds with
  this gem-diol moiety has increased over the last years due to the multidisciplinary
  research studies dedicated to the chemical characterization of this functional group,
  including the assessement of those factors that confer stability to these molecules.
  Gemdiols participate in beneficial chemical reactions involved in the development
  of new therapeutic strategies. Gem-diols may also be of environmental concern; particularly,
  imidazole and pyridine molecules containing either carbonyl or its hydrated groups
  are widely used for the synthesis of metal complexes with relevance in Medicinal
  and Coordination Chemistry due to the ability of gem-diols to coordinate different
  transition metals ions (copper and cobalt) and heavy metals ions (lead, chrome and
  arsenic), thus being attractive molecules to be employed in the synthesis of new
  polymeric materials and/or metal complexes for the catalytic removal of pollutants
  and the design of single-molecule magnets. This chapter will describe the spectroscopic
  techniques available for the identification of this functional group in heterocyclic
  compounds containing carbonyl groups, such as pyridinecarboxaldehyde, vitamin-B6-
  related compounds and imidazolcaboxaldehydes, among others. The aim of this chapter
  is to show that the combination of both single-crystal X-ray diffraction and nuclear
  magnetic resonance allows determining the presence of the gem-diol group together
  with the factors governing the stability and the occurrence of this rare functionalization.
  This chapter will also focus on and discuss the applications of this chemical group
  in organic synthesis, atmospheric processes, and their effect on odorant receptors
  and on the catalytic sites of enzymes. © 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All
