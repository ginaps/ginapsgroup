abstract: Antimicrobial polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic was obtained by covalent
  bonding of poly hexamethylenediamine guanidine hydrochloride (PHMG), a guanidine
  based antimicrobial polymer. This was achieved by grafting mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane
  onto PVC, followed by aminopropyltriethoxysilane. Glutaraldehyde is a bifunctional
  crosslinker that was bonded to the free amine groups found in the treated PVC on
  one side and PHMG on the other. The treated PVC samples were characterized by FT-IR
  and XPS, showing that the PVC samples were successfully modified. Energy Dispersive
  X-ray spectroscopy showed the spatial distribution of the elements Si and S, indicating
  that the coatings were homogeneous. The resulting PVC samples showed high antimicrobial
  activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, the biofilm
  formation was negligible in comparison with the untreated material. The coating
  elusion assay indicated that its antimicrobial ability was achieved via direct contact
  rather than a controlled release mechanism. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
