abstract: The stability of gem-diol forms in imidazolecarboxaldehyde isomers was studied
  by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ss-NMR) combined with single-crystal
  X-ray diffraction studies. These methodologies also allowed determining the factors
  governing the occurrence of such rare functionalization in carbonyl moieties. Results
  indicated that the position of the carbonyl group is the main factor that governs
  the generation of geminal diols, having a clear and direct effect on hydration,
  since, under the same experimental conditions, only 36% of 5-imidazolecarboxaldehydes
  and 5% of 4-imidazolecarboxaldehydes were hydrated, as compared to 2-imidazolecarboxaldehydes,
  with which a 100% hydration was achieved. Not only did trifluoroacetic acid favor
  the addition of water to the carbonyl group but also it allowed obtaining single
  crystals. Single crystals of the gem-diol and the hemiacetal forms 2-imidazolecarboxaldehyde
  and N-methyl-2-imidazolecarboxaldehyde, respectively, were isolated and studied
  through 1H ss-NMR. Mass spectrometry and solution-state NMR experiments were also
  performed to study the hydration process. © 2017 American Chemical Society.
