abstract: The present study describes the selective halogenation at the β-or meso-position
  of the porphyrin macrocycle. The reactions of deuteroporphyrin IX dimethyl ester,
  mesoporphyrin III dimethyl ester and their Cu(II) and Ni(II) complexes with N-bromosuccinimide
  or phenylselenyl chloride were investigated. It could be observed that when the
  bromination of deuteroporphyn IX dimethyl ester using NBS took place, the isolated
  products were the result of an electrophilic substitution in β-free porphyrin ring
  positions. Employing the same reagent for halogenating mesoporphyrin III dimethyl
  ester, which does not possess β-free position, different derivatives were obtained
  from the allylic bromination of the ethyl side chain. When phenylselenyl chloride
  was used as halogenating agent with deuteroporphyn IX dimethyl ester or its Cu(II)
  complex, in both cases the replacement of β-free hydrogen atoms by phenylselenyl
  group was afforded. When the Ni(II) mesoporphyrin III dimethyl ester was used the
  desired and selective replacement of meso hydrogen atoms of aromatic ring by chlorine
  atoms was obtained. The structural assignment of the porphyrin derivatives thus
  obtained was performed by high-resolution mass spectrometry and detailed analysis
  of the NMR spectra. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.
