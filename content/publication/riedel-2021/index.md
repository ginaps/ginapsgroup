abstract: Paclitaxel (PTX) is one of the most effective antineoplastic drugs employed
  for breast and ovarian cancer therapy. However, the neurotoxicity associated with
  PTX administration represents one of its main drawbacks reducing patient life quality.
  Recently, curcumin (CUR) has been explored as a neuroprotective agent due to its
  antioxidant properties. Then, the co-encapsulation of PTX and CUR in a mixed micellar
  formulation could promote a neuroprotective effect of the micellar system and optimize
  breast and ovarian cancer therapy. PTX-CUR-loaded Soluplus:TPGS mixed micelles were
  developed and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance, scattering techniques
  and transmission electron microscopy. In vitro cytotoxicity was evaluated in MDA-MB-231
  and SKOV-3 cancer cells. The in vitro antioxidant performance of CUR-loaded nanoformulations
  was confirmed employing lipid peroxidation inhibition and DPPH colorimetric assays.
  The neuroprotective effect of the micellar formulations was evaluated on zebrafish
  larvae. Mixed micelles demonstrated an excellent colloidal stability, before and
  after freeze-drying. Nanoformulations with both drugs demonstrated the best in vitro
  anticancer performance versus the commercially available nanoformulation Abraxane®
  in breast and ovarian cancer cells lines. The in vitro antioxidant properties of
  the mixed micelles with CUR were confirmed and their in vivo potential neuroprotective
  effect was assessed in the zebrafish model. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.
