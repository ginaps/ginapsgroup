abstract: Coal ash char concentrates from four countries (Portugal, Poland, Romania,
  and South Africa) were prepared, characterised, and graphitized under the scope
  of the Charphite project (Third ERA-MIN Joint Call (2015) on the Sustainable Supply
  of Raw Materials in Europe). Coal ash chars may be a secondary raw material to produce
  synthetic graphite and could be an alternative to natural graphite, which is a commodity
  with a high supply risk. The char concentrates and the graphitized material derived
  from the char concentrates were characterised using proximate analysis, X-ray fluorescence,
  X-ray diffraction (structural), Raman microspectroscopy, solid-state nuclear magnetic
  resonance, scanning electron microscopy, and petrographic analyses to determine
  if the graphitization of the char was successful, and which char properties enhanced
  or hindered graphitization. Char concentrates with a lower proportion of anisotropic
  particles and a higher proportion of mixed porous particles showed greater degrees
  of graphitization. It is curious to see that embedded Al2O3 minerals, such as glass
  and clay, influenced graphitization, as they most likely acted as catalysts for
  crystal growth in the basal direction. However, the graphitized samples, as a whole,
  do not compare well against a reference natural graphite sample despite some particles
  in select char concentrates appearing to be graphitized following graphitization.
