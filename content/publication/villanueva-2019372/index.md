abstract: A smart antibacterial biomaterial based on a keratin hydrogel with pH-dependent
  behavior and Zinc Oxide nanoplates as biocide agent has been developed. The pH of
  a chronic wound is basic due to bacterial metabolism. Originally shrank at acid
  pH, keratin hydrogels swell upon contact with a bacterial contaminated media leading
  to the release of the nanoparticles. The material has been thoroughly characterized
  by infrared spectroscopy, Raman, scanning electron microscope, swelling behavior,
  Differential scanning calorimetry, Small-angle X-ray scattering, rheology, antimicrobial
  activity and cytotoxicity. The results show that 5% of Zinc Oxide nanoparticles
  concentration is the optimum for wound dressing applications. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
