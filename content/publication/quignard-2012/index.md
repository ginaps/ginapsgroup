abstract: A buffer-mediated gelation route for collagen hydrogels that allows the
  formation of homogeneous composite and hybrid materials with various silica sources
  (i.e., colloidal silica and soluble silicates) at high concentration (up to 25 ×
  10 -3 M) is described. Most significant improvement in rheological properties and
  proliferation of primary adult human dermal fibroblasts was obtained for the silicate-based
  hybrid materials. A similar trend was observed in composite materials incorporating
  14 nm SiO 2 nanoparticles, although to a much lesser extent, whereas larger colloids
  (80 and 390 nm) did not significantly impact mechanical stability and cell behavior.
  Modification of 80 nm particles surface with amine groups weakens the collagen-mineral
  interface, resulting in the decrease of material stability and leading to particle
  aggregation during the course of cell proliferation experiments. Modification of
  collagen gelation procedure allows the formation of silicified hydrogels at high
  bioorganic-inorganic content whose structure, mechanical properties and ability
  to promote adhesion and proliferation of primary adult human dermal fibroblasts
  depend on the nature, size, and charge of silica precursors. Copyright © 2012 WILEY-VCH
